# MacShaker
A simple python script to repeatedly change the MAC address on a set time interval.

# Requirements
Will require macchanger. This is preinstalled on Kali Linux but will likely need to be manually installed on other distros.
Obviously requires python, I've only tested with python3 though.

# Details
Both scripts must be run as root.
reset.py will reset your MAC address to its permanent value.
If you, for some reason want to change your MAC address very rapidly, enter 0 as the interval.
